# Determine Feelings on Twitter - Sentiment Analysis

##Existing Technologies

[Stanford University NLP Project](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2009/fp/22.pdf)
The project considers tweets or status updates of www.twitter.com users. Based on the information contained in a tweet, program can answer the following question: does the author of the tweet feel happy, sad or neither about a particular word of her tweet. 
The project uses Python for parsing, MATLAB for analysis and SQLite database for storing the result of twitter keyword searches.

##Proposal

I’m planning to determine how people are feeling when they share something on twitter by analysing their tweets. I’m going to use Twitter API for collecting data for a certain user. Then I’m going to try to extract some information from that data by using simple and effective techniques.
